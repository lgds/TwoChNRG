Here's a quick guide to set up the NRG code:

*********
1 - Untar the tar.gz file
*********

Choose a directory (for instance, "$HOME/(SOME PATH)") and untar the file. It will create the directory "$HOME/(SOME PATH)/TwoChNRG" and store the files in 3 basic directories:

./TwoChNRG/include -> C++ header files
./TwoChNRG/src     -> C++ source codes
./TwoChNRG/doc     -> Documentation

Once you did this, set up the $TWOCHDIR enviroment variable in your .barhsc file. This variable contains the location of the directory where the source files of the NRG code are. 

Let's say you saved the files in $HOME/(SOME DIR)/TwoChNRG . For instance, if your created the "./TwoChNRG" directory in $HOME/MyCodes/, you can add the following to your .bashrc file:

if [ -z $TWOCHDIR ]; then
  TWOCHDIR=$HOME/MyCodes/TwoChNRG
  export TWOCHDIR
fi

Just to make sure everything is ok, do:
$source .bashrc
$echo $TWOCHDIR

It should return something like
/home/yourusername/MyCodes/TwoChNRG

*********
2 - Install the required packages
*********

In addition to a C++ compiler (g++ works fine. gcc has some problems, I guess it's my fault... ), the code will need the following external packages:

Boost - www.boost.org
LAPACK - www.netlib.org/lapack/
Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) - www.gnu.org/s/gsl

which are easy to find in the internet. 

NOTE to CygWin USERS: You can find those packages in the Cygwin installation.

The code will need the ".a"  libraries such as libgsl.a, etc. so make sure these are in a location that is included in the directories the compiler will look for libraries. To check this, you can use the "-v" option in g++ (it will list the directories it is looking for libraries) 
 

*********
3 - Compile the codes 
*********

Now comes the critical part. There are three separate codes that need to be compiled:

Main NRG code    : in $TWOCHDIR/src/Main   -- Use "make"
DM-NRG code      : in $TWOCHDIR/src/DM_NRG -- Use "make"
Conductance      : in $TWOCHDIR/src/DM_NRG -- Use "make Conductance"

The procedure is similar for all three codes so I will illustrate with the first one.

Go in each of the folder above and edit the file called "Makefile" and set the correct value for the variable "$TWOCHDIR" defined above. For instance: 

TWOCHDIR=$(HOME)/MyCodes/TwoChNRG/

(note the "/" in the end. This is important) 

Then exit and do:

$ make

It should compile by now and create a bunch of .o files. If it worked, congratulations! Look at "Using_NRG_main.txt" now.

If it did not compile, open the $TWOCHDIR/src/Main/Makefile with vi or your favorite text editor and start bug-hunting.

Some tips:

- A common error is something like:

"No rule to make target (...) needed by NRG_main"

This means make is not finding the files it needs. 

Check $TWOCHDIR above and see whether the "-I" options are pointing to the right places.

- Sometimes g++ itself will give compilation errors such as not finding a library (LAPACK for instance).

The first thing I would do is to add the "-v" option to the g++ compiler:

$(CXX) -v -c $(CXXFLAGS) $< -o $@

and then see whether it is looking for the libraries at the right places.
 
- E-mail me or call me on gmail chat and we'll try to figure stuff out.

- Pray for the Makefile Gods. Sometimes it works.
