***********
1- Parameter files: 
***********

The NRG_main code has two basic input files:

input_nrg.dat : always called.

Each line correponds to a parameter. A typical file looks like this:
========
71  
1000   
0.5
2.82691E-2
-2.5E-1
2.5
0
0
0
2
9999999 
(other parameters for double dot codes and etc.)
========

where the basic parameters (say, for the Anderson model calculations) are:

========
71     <-- Nsites+1 (length of final Wilson chain)  
1000   <-- Nkept (number of kept states)
0.5    <-- U/D
2.82691E-2  <-- Gamma/D
-2.5E-1 <-- e_d/D
2.5     <-- Lambda
0       <-- chemical potential (band goes from 1-mu to 1+mu  (0 by default)
0       <-- screen (always=0)
0       <-- Update Before Cutting? [0- no (default), 1- yes]
2       <-- calculate spectral density/susceptibility 
        [0 -no, 1- spec density, 2 -chi_imp 3-chi^{(0)}]
9999999 <-- a marker (any integer)
(...)

========

lanc.in : called when options "-b SideDot" , "-b PowerLaw",  "-b Const"  are used.

Typical format (first lines):
====
1
1.0
0.016
0.0
0.0
0.0
====

where the numbers have different meanings depending on whether you are using "SideDot" or "PowerLaw". 

The above example is for "PowerLaw" (Gamma(w)=Gamma_0.|w-w0|^r + small_gamma) so let's explain it.

====
1      <-- Band type (=1 for power-law, =4 for side dot)
1.0    <-- exponent r
0.016  <-- Gamma_0
0.0    <-- small_gamma 
0.0    <-- w0 (=0.0 for E_F at the Dirac point, pseudogap model)
0.0    <-- (nothing in PowerLaw)
====

Z-trick: use "-b Const" and the code will read the value of z from the second line of lanc.in (in the example above, it would do the trivial case  "z=1.0").

***********
2- Calculating suscpetibility and entropy curves. 
***********

You need first to calculate the "chain" susceptbility for the model. Use option "3" in the 10th line of input_nrg.dat and run the code once (ex.: single-channel Anderson model with QS symmetry, the default).

It will produce the following output files, corresponding to the chain susceptibilities: 

===
SuscepChain1Ch_QS_zEQ1.dat
EntropyChain1Ch_QS_zEQ1.dat
===

Then change the 10th line of input_nrg.dat to "2" and run the code again. It will produce the files:

===
EntropyImp1ChQS_Anderson_zEQ1.dat
SuscepImp1ChQS_Anderson_zEQ1.dat
===

Each of these files will have 4 columns: "Temp Tot Chain Imp". 

"Temp" is the temperature. "Tot" is the total susceptibility (or entropy), "Chain" is the susceptibility for the system without the impurity and "Imp=Tot-Chain" is the impurity contribution to the suceptibility (the most important).


Usually, we do plots "Imp x Temp". Thus, if you are using xmgrace to read "SuscepImp1ChQS_Anderson_zEQ1.dat" then read the first column to "x" and the fourth column to "y". Set "x" to a log scale.

A technical detail: the data above are, in the notation of Bulla:

"Imp"=Temp.\chi_imp(Temp)

(the temperature is already multiplying \chi_imp).

(to be done)


ADDED:
 
 - Calculating the occupation vs temperature.

the current version of the code calculates the impurtity occupation versus temperature for the Anderson model (with Q,S and Q,Sz symmetries) 

Run the code as described above (using option "2" in the 10th line of input_nrg.dat) and pipe the output to a text file (e.g. "output_NRG.txt"): 

$NRG_main > output_NRG.txt

The occupation data will be printed in "output_NRG.txt" in lines containing the string "Ndot". To obtain this data, do 


$grep Ndot output_NRG.txt
T= 2.40715 Ndot= 0.970467
T= 1.52242 Ndot= 0.954853
(...)

(In this example, I used  U=0.5 ed=-0.1 Gamma=0.02827. If ed=-U/2, Ndot should be equal to 1).

To save it in a data file (e.g. Ndot_Temp.dat), do

$grep Ndot output_NRG.txt | awk '{print $2 "  " $4}' > Ndot_Temp.dat

***********
3- Calculating dynamical properties (e.g., spectral function) 
***********

For that, we are using DM-NRG code, which uses Hofstetter's "DM-NRG" method and, more recently, has Ander's "Complete Fock State" (CFS) basis implemented as well.

The first step is to run NRG_main as above setting option "1" in the 10th line of inptu_nrg.dat. For instance: 

========
71     <-- Nsites+1 (length of final Wilson chain)  
1000   <-- Nkept (number of kept states)
0.5    <-- U/D
2.82691E-2  <-- Gamma/D
-2.5E-1 <-- e_d/D
2.5     <-- Lambda
1.0     <-- D (always =1.0)
0       <-- tela (always=0)
0       <-- Update Before Cutting? [0- no (default), 1- yes]
1       <-- calculate spectral density/susceptibility 
        [0 -no, 1- spec density, 2 -chi_imp 3-chi^{(0)}]
9999999 <-- a marker (any integer)
(...)

========

Run the "NRG_main" code. It will save binary files ( Abasis_**_N**.bin and Mat*_**_N**.bin) needed later to calculate spectral densities.

Once these files are in place, you can run the "./DM_NRG" code in the SAME directory. Using the defaultsi and for zero temperature, it is simply:

$nice DM_NRG > outputDMNRG.txt &
 
It will calculate the reduced density matrices and save them on "rhoDM_**_N**.bin" files. The spectral densities involving impurity operators c_i and c^\dagger_j will be saved in rho_[i]_[j]_OmegaRhow.dat. 

The number of operators/files will depend on the model. In the case of the Anderson model with QS symmetry, there will be only one file:

rho_0_0_OmegaRhow.dat. 

For the Anderson model with QSz symmetry, there will be two:    

rho_0_0_OmegaRhow.dat -> spin up spectral density. 
rho_1_1_OmegaRhow.dat -> spin down spectral density. 

=== Finite-temperature calculations

The above procedure calculates spectral densities at T=0.

In order to calculate spectral functions at a finite tempererature rho(w,T), NRG has to overcome some difficulties, which have been long stated in the literature. 

At the heart of the problem is the fact that spectral properties are not well resolved for frequencies below the temperature (w<T). Thus, one uses spectral information at energies w>~T. In practice, it means that only NRG data up to a maximum chain lenght M<N such that D_M~T will be used in this calculation. 

In order to calculate rho(w,T) with the DM_NRG code you have to specify this "M"as:

$nice ./DM_NRG -M > output_DMNRG_finiteT.txt &

It will calculate the reduced density matrices and save them on "rhoDM_**_N**.bin" files but up to N=M only. The spectral densities involving impurity operators c_i and c^\dagger_j will be saved as usual in rho_[i]_[j]_OmegaRhow.dat. 

***********
3.1- Practical example
***********

For instance, in the input_NRG.dat file above, we have N+1=71 and Lamda=2.5. The last site of the chain will correspond to an energy scale D_{N}=(1/2)*(1+1/Lambda)*Lambda^{-(N-1)/2} which will be D_{N=70}~1.eE-14. This is, essentially, "zero temperature" for practical purposes.

If we want to calculate the spectral function for a higher temperature of the oder ~10^{-6}, for instance, we can use M=30 which gives D_{M=30}~1.18E-6.

Having run the "NRG_main" code, and with files Abasis_**_N**.bin and Mat*_**_N**.bin in place,  we now erase all rhoDM*.bin files left over and do:

$nice ./DM_NRG -M 30 > output_DMNRG_finiteT.txt &

It will produce rho_0_0_OmegaRhow.dat, which contains the finite-temperature spectral function. The actual value of the temperature can be found in the TempMtemp.dat file.

Of course we will want to do SOMETHING with these files (such as calculating the conductance or resistivity) and this is what we will discuss next.
